Design:

Climb_Chromosome:

I modified the mutate and clone methods, as well as the constructor and destructor.


Tournament_deme:

I stored the P value as a member in the class, and changed the select_parent function to select the fittest parent out of P.



Compiling:

The Makefile is included, compile using make tsp.
